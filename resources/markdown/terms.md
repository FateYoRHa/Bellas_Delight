# Terms of Service

Cancellation of Orders
1. The customers must contact the page (for online orders) or tell the staff immediately if they wish to cancel the order after it has been placed. Customers have the right to cancel provided that the bakery has not yet accepted their order. 

Refund, Exchange, and Return of Product 

2.  The customers are entitled to a refund, exchange, or return of product if the received product is different from what the customer ordered or defective and the customers were not aware of it at the time of purchase. An official receipt is the best proof of purchase to get a replacement or refund.

3. For online payment orders, customers have the right to a refund for a canceled order only if the bakery has not yet accepted their order. Should they still decide to cancel their order after it has been accepted by the bakery, the customers must understand that no refunds (whether in whole or in part) will be issued to them and the customers forfeit the delivery of their canceled order. Furthermore, the customer must also inspect the product upon receiving to verify if it is the correct product or if it is in a good condition. Otherwise, the customer can again ask for a replacement or a refund. A replacement and refund are only acceptable if it is made within 24 hours starting from the time when the product was received.

Payment Methods

4.  Customers can choose to pay for the products they purchased using any of the different payment methods offered including online payments such as GCash, PayPal, and bank transfers; debit or credit cards; any valid gift vouchers; and cash-on-delivery.

Delivery and Pick-Up

5.  Delivery - The delivery personnel shall deliver the customer’s order to the delivery address provided. Customers may choose for their order to be delivered “ASAP” or scheduled for a specific time. An estimated delivery time will be provided to them via text message but delivery times shall vary depending on factors that are not controlled by the personnel.

6.  Delivery Fee - A minimum delivery charge of P85 is implemented for those online orders who choose their orders to be delivered to their desired location, and an additional P20 is added when the location is too far. However, a promotion of free delivery charge is occasionally offered by the owner.

7.  Pick-Up - The customers will have the option of collecting their order in-person directly from the bakery ("Pick-Up") instead of having their order delivered to them.

Discounts and Promotions

8.  From time to time, Bella’s Delights may run marketing and promotional campaigns that offer voucher codes, 20% discounts (Senior/PWD), and other promotional offers.
